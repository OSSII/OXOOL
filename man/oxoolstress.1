.SH NAME
oxoolstress \- stress testing tool for OxOffice Online.
.SH SYNOPSIS
oxoolstress [OPTIONS] SERVER PATH1 TRACE1 ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Re-play trace files, either gzip compressed or verbatim against
a given server URL to simulate load against the server. A single
oxoolstress command can easily replay many concurrent traces.
.PP
If the same PATH is provided for multiple traces, then these are
both executed against the same document.
.SH COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
.PP
.SS "General options:"
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR                Show this usage information.
.SS "SERVER"
The server parameter points to a websocket end-point that would be
used by OxOffice Online to drive a document editing session.
.PP
\fBExample:\fR oxoolstress wss://localhost:9980 /tmp/test.odt test/traces/hello-world.txt
.SS "Generating traces"
To generate a trace, set the following settings to these values in:
\fBoxoolwsd.xml\fR: \fBtrace\fR true, \fBtrace.path\fR /tmp/trace.txt.gz
.PP
Re-start oxoolwsd, edit some documents and then load and
edit a document, after terminating oxoolwsd it should save a trace.
.PP
If passing extra parameters to oxoolwsd pass: --o:trace[@enable]=true --o:trace.path=/tmp/trace.txt.gz.
.PP
.SH "NOTE"
Please note that recording traces generated by mashing the keyboard rapidly creates a pathologically
unrealistic profile that is 10x faster than the average typer, and 5x worse then a professional typist
in terms of keys-per-second, as well as creating unusual documents from a spell/grammar checking
perspective.
